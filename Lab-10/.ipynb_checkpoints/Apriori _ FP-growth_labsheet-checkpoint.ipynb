    "FP-growth is an improved version of the Apriori Algorithm used for Association Rule Mining. It is an analytical process that finds frequent patterns from data sets. For example, grocery store transaction data might have a frequent pattern that people usually buy chips and beer together. The Apriori Algorithm produces frequent patterns by generating itemsets and discovering the most frequent itemset over a threshold “minimal support count”. It greatly reduces the size of the itemset in the database by one simple principle:\n",
    "If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation of Apriori Algorithm is that it requires multiple scans of the database to check the support count of each item and itemsets. When the database is huge, this will cost a significant amount of disk I/O and computing power. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the FP-Growth algorithm scans the database only twice and uses a tree structure to store all the information. The root represents null, each node represents an item, while the association of the nodes is the itemsets with the order maintained while forming the tree. The FP-tree is concise and is used to directly generate large itemsets. Once an FP-tree has been constructed, it uses a recursive divide-and-conquer approach to mine the frequent itemsets.\n"
